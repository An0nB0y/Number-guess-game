# Number-guess-game
Hello, Friend.

What is this for?
- It's for kids between 6 and 12 to learn more and less.

How it works?
- The PC choose a random number between 1 -- 10 (in the first stage). And u enter your guess. If it's low, it says it's low. More than, it's says it's more. If u guess it, u will get some points. And u pass to the next stage. Next stage is harder, but more points :D <3

How did u create it?
- Python

Aaand that's it. GoodBye, Friend <3 :3
